Havoc: an open-source RNG
=========================

The Havoc board uses a pair of RBGs to build random values, and is
presented in a USB-box format. The RBG design comes from Rob Seward[1],
whose design is based on a design by Aaron Logue[2].

A future revision will switch over to a USB-stick interface.
